# Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. 
# It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldnâ€™t it?).

# Iterate through the array starting i 0, if first element bigger than second element swap them
# then continue to second and third element and repeat the process, repeat until array is sorted
